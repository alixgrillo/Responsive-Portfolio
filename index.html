                This quote encompasses the path that Alix Grillo 
                has been on in her career. As a mathematics and history major graduate from Gonzaga University, she was destined
                to be consumed by the insurance industry in one form or another. In her ten years at Great-West Financial, she 
                performed a variety of jobs, including business systems, sales/marketing, operations, and project and relationship
                management. During this time, she also completed an MBA in Risk Management from University of Colorado Denver.

                Then, an amazing thing happened... she took a chance on something that would change her life forever. Her boyfriend
                - who would later be her husband - took an apprenticeship in a small town outside Edinburgh, Scotland and took Alix
                with him. During her time there, she completed an MSc in Business Analytics from the University of Edinburgh. This 
                opened a world of opportunity because she did not even realize how far the world of business analytics and data 
                science stretched. She was exposed to algorithms, processes, and technical capabilities that she did know existed. Her
                capstone work was research to determine a novel approach to solving a resource problem in airport operations using a 
                hybrid simulation and heuristic approach. This work is being published as part of the Winter Simulation Conference.

                All of these twists and turns have led Alix to discover her passion for software and web development. In her current
                role at Charles Schwab as Manager, Risk Analytics, she has opportunities to contribute to the information system 
                supporting her team using a .NET framework with a desktop and web version. As this system is still very much in the 
                development phases, Alix has seen the system come to life. Alix can bring aspects of all her walks of life to a 
                software engineering career and add value to any project that she takes part in.

# Responsive-Portfolio Version 1.0 10/1/2019
modifying portfolio pages to have mobile responsiveness 

## Description
------------------------------------------------
- Homework #1 was to create a professional portfolio site using
HTML/CSS. This should be committed to a GitHub repository and published
using GitPages.

- There are 3 HTML pages that will be described below. Each page
will share the same header style. The header contains a logo that contains
my name and a naviation bar that will direct the user to each of the 
3 pages. The navigation bar will highlight as the cursor is hovered over
the item. Additionally, there should be a background image (vintage-concrete)
that will be visible as the content should only stretch to 960px wide. There
is a footer fixed on each page that contains "Copyright" as a placeholder for 
any future disclosures.

- To account for mobile responsiveness, there are Media Queries built for screens
that are 980px (and less), 768px (and less), and 640px (and less). These Media
Queries adjust the size, position, margin, and padding of objects.

- About (index.html): The About tab contains a header "About Me"
and block text in paragraph form. This is a brief bio about me and contains
two images (on opposite sides of the page).

- Portfolio (portfolio.html): The Portfolio tab contains a header "Portfolio"
and 5 placeholder links (each containing a picture and text) for future links
to portfolio projects. These images are two across and stacked vertically. The
text should be overlayed on the image and positioned toward the bottom of the 
image spanning the entire width of the image.

- Contact (index.html): The Contact tab contains a header "Contact"
and a form capturing 3 pieces of information: Name (with John Smith as an 
example), Email (with example@gmail.com as an example), and Message (default to 
blank). There is a Submit button, which changes colors and cursor style when 
cursor hovers over the button.

- The primary colors used are #4aaaa5 (all teal section), #777777 font color,
#ffffff for main header and main content background, #cccccc for main header 
border color, #666666 for the footer background, and #dddddd for main content
border color.

- The header font is 'Georgia' and content font is 'Arial'.

- All images are contained within the repository in /images folder. All styling
completed by CSS file contained in /css folder. There is a reset.css file that
ensures there are no unintended inheritance from the browser and style.css that
drives all formatting across 3 HTML files. There are also background image options
stored in /background.
